copying files in git with history preserved

git checkout -b dup # create and switch to branch

git mv orig apple # make the duplicate
git commit -m "duplicate orig to apple"

git checkout HEAD~ orig # bring back the original
git commit -m "restore orig"

git checkout - # switch back to source branch
git merge --no-ff dup # merge dup into source branch

original file named 'orig' and the copy of it (with its edit history) in 'apple'.
